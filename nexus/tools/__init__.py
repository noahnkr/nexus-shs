"""MCP wrappers — register_all aggregator.

Exposes the SAME plain functions (vault.queries reads + writes) as MCP tools, so the
conversational agent in a desktop client and the server-side loop share one source of
truth — no self-MCP network hop, no divergence between "what chat can do" and "what the
ambient agents can do."

The surface is split by usage into sibling modules, each exposing `register(target)`:

  - `vault`          — read + vault-write tools (shared with the loop's toolset)
  - `knowledge_base` — MCP-only KB curation (`ingest_file` · `ingest_batch` · `set_note_status`)
  - `workflows`      — MCP-only workflow build & manage tools
  - `connectors`     — ⚙ per-connector `tools()` seam (fork seam)

CRITICAL: register read + vault-write tools only. No external-send tool.
